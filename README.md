### Get Started

- Install NodeJS **LTS** version from <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/?ref=creativetim">NodeJs Official Page</a>
- Download the product on this page
- Unzip the downloaded file to a folder in your computer
- Open Terminal
- Go to your file project (where youâ€™ve unzipped the product)
- (If you are on a linux based terminal) Simply run `npm run install:clean`
- (If not) Run in terminal `npm install`
- (If not) Run in terminal `npm run build:tailwind` (each time you add a new class, a class that does not exist in `src/assets/styles/tailwind.css`, you will need to run this command)

- Check more about [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/?ref=creativetim)

### Pages

If you want to get inspiration or just show something directly to your clients,
you can jump start your development with our pre-built example pages. You will be able
to quickly set up the basic structure for your web project.

Here are all the page from the project:
  - [Tables](https://demos.creative-tim.com/notus-react/admin/tables?ref=nr-github-readme)



### Fully Coded Components

Notus React is built with over frontend 120 components, giving you the freedom of choosing and combining. All components can take variations in colors, that you can easily modify using Tailwind CSS classes (NOTE: each time you add a new class, a class that does not exist in `src/assets/styles/tailwind.css`, you will need to compile again tailwind).

You will save a lot of time going from prototyping to full-functional code, because all elements are implemented.
This Free Tailwind CSS Template is coming with prebuilt examples, so the development process is seamless, switching from our pages to the real website is very easy to be done.

Every element has multiple states for colors, styles, hover, focus, that you can easily access and use.
